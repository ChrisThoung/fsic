# Godley and Lavoie (2007) *Monetary economics*

FSIC implementations of stock-flow consistent models from Godley and Lavoie
(2007).

There is one script per model, with naming convention as follows:

	X_yyy.py

where `X` is the chapter number and `yyy` is the model name e.g. '3_sim.py'.


## Usage

To simulate each model:

1. Run the model script with *this folder* as the current working directory.

See the docstrings of the individual scripts for details of the outputs.
