eval
====
Example to show how to use `eval()` as an alternative to statements that
operate on the `BaseModel` (or `BaseLinker`) objects themselves. This works in
a similar way to `eval()` in pandas.

**Note that `eval()` uses the Python `eval()` function**.

The example model in this script is a simplified five-equation version of
Godley and Lavoieâ€™s (2007) Model *SIM*.

    # Calculate the stationary state flow of aggregate income -----------------

    # simple expression like this)
