==============
Example of how to generate and link Fortran code for faster model solution,
comparing performance gains from making the substitution at different points.

The example model in this script is a simplified five-equation version of
Godley and Lavoieâ€™s (2007) Model *SIM*.

**Requires NumPy with a working F2PY setup.**

The solution of a model can be divided into:

1. The outer solution loop, over a sequence of periods e.g. 2018, 2019 etc.
   This is handled by the `solve()` method.
2. For each period, an inner iteration loop, which repeatedly evaluates the
   system of equations, continuing until, hopefully, the solution converges.
   This is handled by the `solve_t()` method.
3. The evaluation step itself, which represents one pass through the system.
   This is embedded in the `_evaluate()` method, which must be defined for each
   model implementation.

In the core implementation, all three are written in Python, operating on NumPy
arrays. The `fsic.fortran` module provides tools to generate Fortran
equivalents. The Fortran implementations are then wrapped in Python methods
with identical interfaces to the original Python code. This way, the user
doesn't need to make any changes to how they call the code while benefitting
from any speed gains.

Performance gains depend on whether the faster solution outweighs the
additional overhead of transferring data from Python to Fortran and back
again. In practice, calls to `_evaluate()` take *longer* (are slower) using the
Fortran version because of the time needed to move data around. Using the
Fortran version of `solve_t()` does confer speed gains because of the more
limited data transfer (in and out just once per period). The Fortran version of
`solve()` is faster still because data transfer only happens at the start and
end of the process, regardless of the number of periods.
