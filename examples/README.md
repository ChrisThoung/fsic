# FSIC examples

Example applications of FSIC, including implementations of economic models, and
tips and tricks.

While FSIC's only dependency for model solution is [NumPy](https://numpy.org/),
note that these examples also make use of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
(to present the results in a convenient format) and
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (to produce charts).

See the individual files and folders for other *ad hoc* dependencies.
